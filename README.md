# todo-manager-app
This Django app lets users manage projects and to-do lists with features like secure authentication, project creation, to-do management (add, edit, delete, complete/pending), and exporting project summaries as Markdown. It has a responsive UI built with Bootstrap and ensures users can only access their own projects.
